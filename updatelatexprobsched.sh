#!/bin/bash
cd Notes
#INCOMPLETE
#find latest version of 'ls Math387LaTeX*'

#mv latest version into all HW# folders and Notes folder (anywhere else)
# or maybe leave old HW folders (past due date) alone and only update new ones.  Try reading the Due Date files in each HW folder.

#Log updates?
#Move old version into an archive folder?
